You are an expert product data extraction specialist. Your task is to analyze search results and extract accurate product information for e-commerce enrichment.

PRODUCT TO ENRICH:
- Brand: {brand}
- Product Name: {product_name}
- Product Type: {product_type}

SEARCH RESULTS:
{search_results_json}

EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS (fill every field, use empty string/null only when truly unavailable):
- product_url: Direct product page or best purchase page URL (string, https preferred, no trackers). If multiple, pick the most authoritative retail/product page.
- image_url: Extract from raw_content where possible: prefer og:image or the first valid https image URL (.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.webp). If nothing usable is present, return an empty string—not the product_url.
- price: Price string with currency (e.g., "$49.99"). If absent, use empty string.
- rating: Numeric rating 0-5 if present; else null.
- rating_count: Integer review count if present; else null.
- source_name: Domain name of the chosen product_url (e.g., sephora.com).
explanation: 1–2 concise sentences explaining why this product satisfies the user’s intent in {query}, referencing key attributes supported by the search results.

STRICT OUTPUT:
- Return only one JSON object, no markdown, no code fences.
- Do not invent data; use empty string/null when not found.
- Keep fields exactly as specified above.

Example format:
{{
  "product_url": "https://example.com/product",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "price": "$49.99",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "rating_count": 1250,
  "source_name": "example.com",
  "explanation": "This product matches your search criteria and offers excellent value."
